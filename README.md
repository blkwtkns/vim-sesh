# vim-sesh

### TODO:
* Add environment variables to determine vim or neovim
* Set default session location, and allow user mutation
* Edge case usage
* Do not use yet!

## Many thanks to itchyny
His functions within his plugin at: https://github.com/itchyny/vim-gitbranch - they allowed me to strip out all dependencies (though technically I'm still dependent on his logic!)

The rest is pretty much logic from here: http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Go_away_and_come_back that I then bent to my will.

#Cheers!
